##  Project Description

**MethylCraft** is a responsive, interactive web tool for designing methylation PCR primers and methylation-specific probes for bisulfite-converted DNA sequences. Users only need to provide the original DNA sequence with optional searching criteria.  

Built on top of the `primer3-py` library (a Python API for Primer3), the app allows users to:

- Automatically perform **in silico bisulfite conversion**
- Customize primer/probe design: Tm, GC content, product size, salt/dNTP concentrations
- Identify both methylation-sensitive (M-Probe) and methylation-insensitive (U-Probe) probes
- Quickly copy sequences and view detailed thermodynamic metrics

> Designed for researchers and students investigating DNA methylation.
